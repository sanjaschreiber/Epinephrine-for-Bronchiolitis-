#### Sequence generation
###### *This domain pertains to the following:*

-	Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?
-	Randomization ensures that the groups being compared are balanced for known and unknown confounders
- Inadequate sequence generation can overestimate treatment effects by 12% (ROR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79,0.99) 

##### Please, make a decision, based on the following criteria: 
| RoB decision  | Criteria |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| **Low**      | if the authors described a random component in sequence generation process (e.g., computer-generated random numbers, coin toss, random number table). |
| **Unclear**      | if insufficient data is provided to make a judgment (e.g., only described as: random, randomly generated, randomized, etc). NOTE: Statements that groups were blocked or stratified should NOT be considered sufficient for a ‘yes/low risk’ rating unless accompanied by a description indicating the sequence was computer generated. |  
| **High** | if no randomization or inappropriate randomization (e.g. alternation, assignment based on birth date or day of hospital admission).|

#### Allocation Concealment
###### *This domain pertains to the following:*
- Was allocation adequately concealed?
- Allocation concealment ensures that the randomization sequence is unknown to the person entering participants into a trial until allocation to an intervention has occurred.
- Inadequate allocation concealment can exaggerate treatment effects by 18% (ROR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71,0.94) 

##### Please, make a decision, based on the following criteria: 
| RoB decision  | Criteria |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| **Low**      | Sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance. Central allocation with description (i.e. pharmacy, web-based, call-in) Randomization sequence maintained by a 3rd party uninvolved in the investigation or off-site. Central allocation, but no further description is provided. Use context to determine whether this better fits in ‘low’ or ‘unclear.’|
| **Unclear**      | No statement. Includes 1 or 2 of: opaque, sealed, sequentially numbered envelops is described, but does not use ALL 3 descriptors. Randomization sequence is kept on site (with no further description). |  
| **High** | Open allocation schedule. Any method in which the investigators could foresee the group assignment (e.g. alternation, date of birth, etc).|

#### Blinding of participants and personnel 
###### *This domain pertains to the following:*

- Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?
- Blinding of key individuals in a trial can minimize performance and detection bias.
- Studies not described as “double-blind” can overestimate treatment effects by 9% (ROR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83,1.0) 
- Results not consistent across studies
 
##### Please, make a decision, based on the following criteria: 
| RoB decision  | Criteria |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| **Low**      | No blinding or incomplete blinding, but the outcome is unlikely to be influenced by lack of blinding. Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken. Description of “double-blinding” with specification that the participants and study personnel are blinded. Description of the use of “double-dummy” or “matched placebo.”|
| **Unclear** | Insufficient information to permit judgment. The study did not address blinding. | 
| **High** | No blinding or incomplete blinding and the outcome is likely to be influenced. Blinding attempted, but likely that it could have been broken and the outcome is likely to be influenced.|

#### Blinding of outcome assessment 
###### *If 3rd party assessor is not mentioned, use the same assessment as for blinding of participants and personnel. If 3rd party assessor is mentioned, use the following algorithm:*
| RoB decision  | Criteria |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| **Low**      | **[1]** If the assessors was adequatly blinded regardless of whether an outcome was subjective or objective. **[2]** If the assessor was not blinded or if it is unclear whether an assessor was blinded, but the outcome was objective. |
| **Unclear**      | If the assessor was not blinded or if it is unclear whether an assessor was blinded, but the outcome was subjective. |  
| **High** | If the assessor was not blinded and the outcome was subjective. |

#### Incomplete Outcome Data
###### *This domain pertains to the following:*

- Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?
- Per protocol analyses may yield more favorable estimates compared to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses.
- “Modified” ITT* may overestimate treatment effects by 15% (ROR 0.85, 95% CI 0.81,0.88) .
- Results not consistent across studies.

##### Please, make a decision, based on the following criteria: 
| RoB decision  | Criteria |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| **Low**      |  ITT and dropout rate <10% OR No ITT, dropout rate <10%, and number and reasons for withdrawal balanced between groups. |
| **Unclear**  | ITT and/or dropout rate between 10 and 30%.|  
| **High** | Dropout rate ≥30% OR Dropout rate <30%, but number and reason for dropouts very imbalanced between groups. Per protocol analysis only (unless under of patients switching groups is too small to make any important difference to the estimated intervention effect). |

#### Selective outcome reporting
###### *This domain pertains to the following:*

- Is there an indication that the reports are free of selective outcome reporting (SOR)?
- SOR occurs when a subset of the original variables recorded for investigation in the protocol is presented in the publication.
- It may also be indicated by discrepancies in the primary outcomes proposed and those reported.
- Statistically significant outcomes are more likely to be completely reported than non-significant outcomes (range of odds ratios 2.2 to 4.7) 

##### Please, make a decision, based on the following criteria:
| RoB decision  | Criteria |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| **Low**      |  No discrepancies between outcomes listed in the protocol and those described in the results. No discrepancies between methods section and results section in the study report(s). |
| **Unclear**      | N/A|  
| **High** | Outcomes are not identified in the protocol or methods section that are not described in the results section of the report. |

#### Other sources of bias
###### *This domain pertains to the following:*

- “Catch-all” domain
- Source of funding or early stopping should not be assessed in “other sources” of bias; however, continue to extract these items and report them in the results/discussion sections. 
o	Conduct a sensitivity analysis for studies that received industry funding versus no industry funding.
o	Conflict of interest can be assessed in the “publication bias” domain of GRADE
- Specific “other sources” of bias will not be identified to assess for each project. 

##### Please, make a decision, based on the following criteria:
| RoB decision  | Criteria |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| **Low**      | No other sources of bias are identified.This is the default assessment. |
| **Unclear**      | N/A |  
| **High** | Other sources of bias such as: participant characteristics (baseline imbalances), study design characteristics (crossover, cluster randomized, blocked randomization in unblinded trials). |
